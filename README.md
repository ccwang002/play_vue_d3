## Playground for Vue.js and D3.js
Boilerplate by [vue-cli] version 3.0.0-beta.6, which is based on webpack version 3.10.0.
Webpack 4 will be used in future (there is a `webpack4` WIP branch).

The javascript is written in ES2015 and follows [JavaScript Standard Style].
Use Bootstrap v4.1 and SCSS for styling.

Use D3.js version 5.1.
